## Technologies

## Setup
The project is split into two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend is a Vue3 application, and the backend is a Laravel API. The frontend is located in the `frontend` directory, and the backend is located in the `backend` directory.

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up `.env` file in the backend directory
3. Run `composer install`, `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan serve` in the backend directory
4. Start live server in the frontend directory and navigate to the localhost address
